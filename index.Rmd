<span style="color:blue">1. Problem solving:</span> This involves looking for alternatives and possible solutions. In line with analytical skills and attention to detail. These competencies allow to evaluate options and choose the best one according to the needs of the clients.

<span style="color:blue">2. Pressure management:</span> To work well under pressure, the key is to know when to ask for help. Do not take on more than you can handle and if so, let your colleagues or manager know when you need help. If you are in charge, learn to delegate tasks and encourage people.

<span style="color:blue">3. Diplomacy:</span> Becoming a good diplomat will be necessary because things change quickly in the tourism and leisure sector. Flight delays, fully booked hotels or bad weather affect holidays and travel. You must be prepared to deal with dissatisfied customers, manage conflicts and act quickly to offer a solution.

# 4. Why study *Statistics*?

<div style="font-size: 29px">

The <span style="color:blue">general objective of the course is to introduce the student to statistical reasoning</span>, with special emphasis on the resolution of problems of an economic and business nature, preferably related to activity in the tourism sector.

We will use the main tools of Descriptive Statistics applied to the <span style="color:green">processing and analysis of data from tourism activity</span>, also making reference to the main statistical sources related to tourism.

Knowledge of basic statistical concepts is essential to facilitate <span style="color:red">decision-making in the field of tourism business</span>, as it allows for the analysis and interpretation of economic data and data from the tourism sector. Likewise, the notions learnt by the student in the *Introduction to Statistics* serve as support for the learning of other subjects found in the programme of the Degree such as Marketing or Economics.
